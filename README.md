Note: It is important that if you are going to use this code, the csv files
are placed in a directory that you can pull them from, idealy a 'Resources' folder
in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook files. Otherwise you will have to modify
that part of the code to read your csv files.

This repository consists of a Team Project using Jupyter Notebook:
